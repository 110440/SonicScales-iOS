## Physics of a string
### Wave
The speed of propagation of a wave in a string is proportional to the square root of the string's tension and inversely proportional to the square root of its linear density.

### Frequency
Once the speed of propagation is known, the frequency of the sound produced by the string can be calculated.

### Mass
If you know the length and the diameter of the string, the material from which it is made and the frequency of the sound, you can find the mass of the object being weighed.
